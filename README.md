VideoBrain core for openFPGA on Analogue Pocket
-

Enjoy VideoBrain games with this core. 

This core really needs a keyboard via the dock to be useful.

Also, the following files are required:

The keyboard is very strange on this.  It has no enter key, and has relatively few
keys in general.  There is a shift key, but you do not hold it down to shift- you
tap it, so it's basically a shift lock key.

Caps lock is mapped to the shift key, and all dual purpose keys that can be mapped
are.  i.e. W and 7 share the same key, so on the USB keyboard, both W and 7 map to the
same key on the Videobrain.

If you are not shifted, pressing 7 will get you a W, for example.  The system only
has upper case letters.

There are a few other special keys and they are mapped as so:

F1 - erase/restart  
F2 - space/run stop  
F3 - special/alarm  
F4 - next/clock  
F5 - previous/color  
F6 - back/text
